# Swooper Logbook Web App

A personal mobile-friendly web application for tracking skydiving jumps. Data can be stored in Google Spreadsheet for multiple device access and backup.

This vibe-coded app was conceived for swoopers to keep track on the number of jumps on their linesets.

## Features
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design
- 🪂 Jump entry with location and equipment tracking
- 📊 Auto-incrementing jump numbers (configurable starting number)
- 🔧 **Equipment system** - Manage harnesses, canopies, and linesets (per canopy)
- 📊 **Component-level statistics** - Track usage by harness, canopy, and lineset
- 💫 **Equipment archiving** - Archive canopies/linesets while preserving statistics
- 📍 **Drop zone statistics** - Track your most visited locations
- �📋 Google Sheets integration for data storage
- 🔄 Offline-capable with sync when online
- 📤 Export data to CSV
- ⚙️ Configurable settings

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. **Set up equipment**:
   - Go to Equipment tab → Harnesses to add your harness(es) (e.g., Javelin, Mutant)
   - Go to Canopies to add your canopies (e.g., Petra64, Petra68), each with one or more linesets (e.g., #1, #2)
3. **Log jumps**: On the Jumps tab, add a jump and select harness, canopy, and lineset
4. **View stats**: Check Statistics tab for component-level analytics
5. Optional: Configure Google Sheets integration for cloud backup and synchronization across devices

## Equipment Management

The app uses a three-component equipment system:

### **Components**
- **Harnesses**: Your harness/container systems (e.g., Javelin Odyssey, Mutant) - for book-keeping only
- **Canopies**: Your parachutes (e.g., Petra64, Petra68, Sabre2 120), each with one or more linesets
- **Linesets**: Attached to each canopy, numbered automatically (e.g., #1, #2, #3)

When logging a jump, you just select a canopy (with the latest lineset)

### **Archiving**
- Archive canopies when you stop using them
- Archived equipment won’t appear in the jump logging dropdown
- All statistics are preserved for archived equipment

### **Statistics**
- **Component level**: Track usage by canopy and lineset
- **Drop zones**: Your most visited locations

This system gives you detailed insights into your gear usage and helps track equipment lifecycles.
